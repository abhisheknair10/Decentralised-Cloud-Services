# DeCS Storage

## Introduction
### DeCS Storage is a decentralised cloud infrastructure that can store your personal and important data on the cloud. 

### The data is not stored on any dedicated DeCS data server, but is rather saved on multiple decentralised nodes that are active on the DeCS Network. The data is always encrypted during storage and transmission. Your data is only decrypted when it is recieved by the user on their authorized device.
